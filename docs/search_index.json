This inspired our team to explore people’s alcohol consumption preferences. After browsing through a number of official government statistics websites, we were very fortunate to find historical records of alcohol consumption in Iowa for 2019 on the Iowa government website. We wonder if we can discover some of the alcohol consumption preferences of Iowa residents, and if store owners and suppliers might be able to rationalize the wholesale and inventory of alcohol if they are aware of people’s preferences. In this 2019 Iowa Liquor Sales dataset, there are very few missing values and as many as 24 attributes, which include Date of consumption, Store Name, Category Name, Vendor name and more, detailing every single alcohol consumption. In addition, this dataset is rich in Catigorical Data as well as Numerical Data, and we can use as many kinds of charts as possible to explore the data in the subsequent analysis. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic We will analyze the dataset from three main perspectives. Firstly, we will select some purchase volume indicators to show people’s drinking preferences. Then, we will analyze whether preferences differ between regions in Iowa from a geographic perspective. Finally, we will analyze whether people’s alcohol consumption follows the seasons from a temporal perspective. People’s drinking preferences We will use attributes such as Category Name, Sale (Dollars), etc. to represent people’s consumption preferences. For example, we will find out which liquors are the most popular in Iowa and which are the least popular. Which type of alcohol had the highest turnover in 2019. Whether people buy alcohol in large or small quantities. Regional perspective In addition, detailed geographic information is given in the dataset, which includes the store address, the county and the city where it is located. We want to study the differences in people’s alcohol consumption in different regions. For example, at which administrative level is there an obvious difference in alcohol consumption, the City level or the County level or the Zipcode level? Timing perspective Finally, our dataset also records the time of each alcoholic beverage purchase, with data accurate to the day. We will use the Date to explore whether Iowa residents’ consumption of alcohol is influenced by season. Whether there are significant cyclical variations in people’s consumption of alcohol, etc. 2.2 Data availability In this 2019 Iowa Liquor Sales dataset, there are very few missing values. There are as many as 24 attributes, which include Date of consumption, Store Name, Category Name, Vendor name and more, detailing every single alcohol consumption. In addition, this dataset is rich in Catigorical Data as well as Numerical Data, and we can use as many kinds of charts as possible to explore the data in the subsequent analysis. The dataset was collected from grocery stores, liquor stores, convenience stores and so on which has Class E liquor license. If we encounter some questions, we can simply submit contact request form in Iowa government website. How to use the data? We can export it as csv file and import to Rstudio. The dataset consists of 2.38 million points with 24 columns. In this particular project, we will discard the identification information such as “Invoice Number”, “Store Adress”, “Item Number”, etc. In the next modules, Catigorical Data and Numerical Data, we analyze each of the attributes contained in the database, their size, origin and some characteristics. 2.2.1 Catigorical Data Date: from 01/02/2019 to 12/31/2019.

Bottle Volume (Volume of each liquor bottle ordered in milliliters) column Bottle Volume (ml) has a mean of 876.64, a standard deviation of 521.43, a min of 20.0, a median of 750.0, and a max of 6000.0 State Bottle Cost (The amount that the Alcoholic Beverages Division paid for each bottle of liquor ordered) column State Bottle Cost has a mean of 10.34, a standard deviation of 8.57, a min of 0.89, a median of 8.25, and a max of 1749.12 Bottles Sold (The number of bottles of liquor ordered by the store) column Bottles Sold has a mean of 11.28, a standard deviation of 31.31, a min of 1.0, a median of 6.0, and a max of 6750.0 State Bottle Retail (The amount the store paid for each bottle of liquor ordered) column State Bottle Retail has a mean of 15.52, a standard deviation of 12.86, a min of 1.34, a median of 12.38, and a max of 2623.68 Sale (Total cost of liquor order (number of bottles multiplied by the state bottle retail) column Sale (Dollars) has a mean of 146.71, a standard deviation of 487.18, a min of 1.34, a median of 75.36, and a max of 78435.0 Volume Sold (Total volume of liquor ordered in liters) column Volume Sold (Liters) has a mean of 9.37, a standard deviation of 38.24, a min of 0.02, a median of 4.8, and a max of 11812.5 Volume Sold: column Volume Sold (Gallons) has a mean of 2.47, a standard deviation of 10.1, a min of 0.0, a median of 1.26, and a max of 3120.53. This column should be a simple linear transformation of the the above column. (Data description is from 2019 Iowa Liquor Sales dataset which recording the information on liquor sales in Iowa.) "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources In this 2019 Iowa Liquor Sales dataset, there are very few missing values. There are as many as 24 attributes, which include Date of consumption, Store Name, Category Name, Vendor name and more, detailing every single alcohol consumption. In addition, this dataset is rich in Catigorical Data as well as Numerical Data, and we can use as many kinds of charts as possible to explore the data in the subsequent analysis. The dataset was collected from grocery stores, liquor stores, convenience stores and so on which has Class E liquor license. We can export it as csv file and import to Rstudio. The dataset consists of 2.38 million points with 24 columns. With reference to the purpose of our study, we do not need to use all of the data. Basic information about the data: We sampled out 100,000 items of data on alcohol sales. Among them, the records with some missing columns are 303, less than 0.3% of the total. A total of 1735 stores contributed data, and the data included 53 types of wine. We have already covered continuous data and categorical data in detail in data availability section. Describe any issues / problems with the data: We did find some data issues, for example, all Sunday sales data was missing from our dataset. Outside of the initial time, a portion of the Saturday data was also missing. This part of missing is not shown in the missing value analysis because a whole row of data is not recorded. The absence of this part of the data slightly affected our analysis. In the time series analysis part, we were able to find that the sales figures were higher in the second half of the year, and one of the factors was the presence of Saturday data in the second half of the year. To avoid this issue from affecting our exploration of data periodicity, we choose pin Friday data to explore whether the data are cyclical. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Originally, raw data contains 2380345 rows, since the source data file size is too large, the source file is over 500MB, which exceeds the limit of GitHub upload and R manipulation, we first used Python to randomly sample 100000 data as the research data for this project. Then, to ensure as efficient a run as possible in the study, we removed some columns that were not very relevant to the research, or that were related to other columns. Like Store Location, which accurate to latitude and longitude in raw dataset. We do not think we need to include Store Location since the Zip code variable seems more usable. Similarly, we delete address variable. AS for Invoice/Item Number, it is just the id of each flow, and we think that the multivariate afterwards can avoid duplication. 3.3 Missing value analysis To explore the presence of missing values, we first count how many missing values exist for each column. From the displayed results, we have a small percentage of missing values in our dataset, for example Store Name, Store Number, Date and these columns do not have missing values. The attributes that do have the highest number of values are concentrated in City, Zip Code, County Number, County. And they have the same exact data, which inspired us to explore the pattern of missing values. ## City Zip Code County Number County Category ## 188 188 188 188 115 ## Category Name Bottles Sold State Bottle Cost State Bottle Retail Volume Sold (Gallons) ## 115 7 1 1 1 ## Date Store Number Store Name Vendor Number Vendor Name ## 0 0 0 0 0 ## Item Number Item Description Pack Bottle Volume (ml) Sale (Dollars) ## 0 0 0 0 0 The package naniar provides us with a good visualization method. gg_miss_upset function visually shows us what the missing data values are and which columns have missing values. In addition to that, there are some associated missing values column, connected by a solid black line. There is a clear and strong correlation between the geographical location and the attributes of the city. In City, Zip Code, County Number, County. Once one is missing, all other values are also missing. They are a set of combinations together. In addition, another independent missing value attribute is Category Name, but there are not many, out of 100,000 data, only 115 data do not have this attribute. Since the absence of a particular attribute in the data is rare, direct deletion does not affect the rendering of the data. We choose to delete the missing value using na.omit() function. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 People’s drinking preferences 4.2 Regional perspective 4.3 Timing perspective", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 People’s drinking preferences To explore the drinking preferences of the people of Iowa, we identified the twenty best-selling liquors in Iowa. We chose a bubble chart to show as much data as possible. In a bubble chart, we can use horizontal and vertical coordinates, bubble color, and bubble size to present as much data as possible. Furthermore, we use plotly to generate interaction function. The graph shows that Iowa residents have a clear preference for American Vodkas and Canadian Whiskies. These two liquors are far ahead of other brands in terms of sales. All other liquor sales are concentrated within a range of approximately 1M. Secondly, the factor of price does not play a very significant role in the consumption of liquor. The high sales volume like Canadian Whiskies, it is not cheap the average price is 14.439. Some cheaper liquors, such as American Dry Gin, Blended Whiskies, are no more popular than 100% Agave Tequila. Then, we wanted to know which liquors are good for bulk purchases as well as family gatherings in Iowa. Is the reason for the high sales in the previous chart a large volume purchase? In this graph, American Vodkas and Canadian Whiskies unsurprisingly leads the pack, except that Whiskies Liqueur is the newest popular object and people like to buy them in bulk. The barchat shows, respectively, how many bottles of this liquor people buy at a time. In terms of purchase volume, Whiskies Liqueur is the most likely to be bought in groups, people often buy 96 bottles at a time. In general, bulk purchases are not very common, and buying 12 bottles at a time is a favorite. 4.2 Regional perspective Note that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. The dataset includes three events (bottles sold in hundreds, sales in hundreds of dollars, and volume sold in gallons) for 99 counties. For demonstration purposes, only the top 30 counties are included in the graph (ordered by the number of bottles sold). The three events exhibit a positive correlation For demonstration purposes, only the top three best-selling liquor categories for the top 30 counties. Among 53 different liquor types, nine appeared to be the top-selling category for the selected counties. In addition, whisky and vodka are frequently among the top-selling categories for the selected counties. The map shows each county’s liquor sales (in dollars) with dark blue being the county with the highest dollar sales. We notice that counties with higher sales are most likely to include larger cities, suggesting that liquor sales are proportional to county population. Since sales are positively correlated to total bottles_sold and volume_sold (shown earlier with Cleveland dot plot), we speculate that the latter two variables are also proportional to county population. 4.3 Timing perspective There is a slight increase in the total amount of bottles sold in all categories of liquor from January to December in 2019. The daily amount of bottles sold mainly clusters between 3000 and 5000. The plot shows there are several low values and one zero in daily amount of bottles sold. We speculate that the data is not complete these days. The plot shows that people in Iowa do not purchase as much liquor in the first quarter in 2019 as they do in the other quarters. There is a significant increase in monthly bottles sold from March to April in 2019. The increase is approximately 22500 bottles. It is initially assumed that the consumption of liquor during the first quarter of the year is higher since the weather is cold, which contradicts what the data illustrates. We speculate the reason is that people tend not to go out as often due to the cold and snowy weather. In the first quarter of 2019, the daily bottles sold on Fridays cluster near 2000. After the first quarter, the daily bottles sold on Fridays cluster near 5000. In the first quarter, the daily bottles sold on Fridays are often at the lower end among other days of the week. After the first quarter, it gradually shifts to a higher position. The data set does not include any Sunday data. Saturday data is partially included, and it is not possible to draw informative conclusions from incomplete data. There is no observable difference in the trend in liquor sales among weekdays. The purple region highlights the bottles sold during Thanksgiving Holiday and the green region highlights the bottles sold during Christmas. However, the sales of liquor during the holiday seasons is not as high as expected since not all the stores open during holidays and people tend to prepare liquor before holidays.

First step: click anywhere in graph area, title show up! Then, you can click any ball at bottom of graph, the ball will transit to specific place! "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion Findings: In this project, we have discovered several key findings regarding the liquor sales in Iowa: In Iowa American Vodkas and Canadian Whiskies are the most popular liquors and people often buy them in large quantities. We found that there is a seasonal trend on the Iowa liquor sales. In the first quarter, Fridays are often the day with lowest sales of a given week, but the sales gradually increase throughout the year and exceed average by the last quarter. The liquor sales of different counties are positively correlated with the number of large cities in the given county. Future improvement: D3: Due to the limited data amount, we could have used other graph structures such as a line graph. While the scatter plot clearly shows the trend of monthly liquor sales, a line graph can better demonstrate the value difference in between each month. In the future, we would like to include more interactive features such as the coordinates of each point, slope between points, and a best fit line. Data Manipulation: We believe that the introduction of an auxiliary dataset that includes complementary information such as demographic, geographic, or climate data, would significantly improve our capability to produce meaningful insights. Solely relying on the liquor sale dataset limits our analysis to mostly speculations and does not allow us enough data to verify our assumptions. Plotly: Throughout the project, we are amazed by the power of interactive graphs. Hence, in the future, we would like to include more interactive graphs as they are usually more concise while providing just as much insights as conventional static visualization methods. In addition, it will allow the viewers to extract useful information without tediously iterating through each point on the graph. The diversity of graph structures is another aspect we would like to make improvements on. We believe that having diversified graphs enables us to examine each variable and the relationships between them from different perspectives.
